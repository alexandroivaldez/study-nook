I updated the draggable component to ensure that widgets remain within the bounds of the parent container.

I added a toolbar for future toggling and management of widgets. To ensure the draggable space has as much room as possible without interference from the toolbar, I positioned the toolbar absolutely. This setup allows the toolbar to overlay on top of the draggable area while keeping the workspace flexible and uncluttered.

Created the base for the project, used `react-draggable` to create an area where I can drag widgets around.
